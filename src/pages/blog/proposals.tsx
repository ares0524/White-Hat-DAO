export const proposal = `Dear White Hat Dao,
I am writing to propose the creation of a DSO (Decentralized Standard of Organization) to bring transparency and revolutionize the DeFi industry. 
As we all know, the DeFi space has been facing a significant challenge due to a lack of standardization. 
There are too many protocols, platforms, and projects, making it hard for users to trust the system. 
We can solve this problem by creating a standard that will bring order to chaos and bring trust to Web 3.0.
The proposed standard will be the first of its kind and will set the benchmark for other decentralized organizations to follow. 
It will ensure that all DeFi projects and platforms operate transparently and accountably, following a set of guidelines and best practices. By doing so, we will be able to create a level playing field for everyone involved in the DeFi industry, reducing the risks of fraud, hacking, and other malicious activities.
We can draw inspiration from the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) that has transformed the centralized industries. 
The ISO has brought about a fundamental shift in how businesses operate, creating an environment of transparency, accountability, and trust. Similarly, our proposed standard will do the same for the decentralized space. 
It will make it easier for people to trust DeFi projects and platforms, attract more investment, and promote innovation. While keeping web 3 decentralized.
As the leader and founder of this principle, the White Hat DAO will be at the forefront of the revolution in DeFi. 
We will be seen as the pioneers who initiated the change that was necessary to make DeFi a safer and more reliable space. 
This will give us a significant competitive advantage, attracting more members and investors who want to be part of the revolution.
In conclusion, I believe that the creation of a White Hat DAO in DSO to establish a standard for the DeFi industry is an obvious gap that needs to be filled. 
We can create a standard that will bring transparency, accountability, and trust to the decentralized space, and transform the industry for the better. 
Let us work together to make this vision a reality and make the White Hat DAO the leader in the DeFi space.
Thank you for considering this proposal.

Sincerely,
Affirmation2021`
