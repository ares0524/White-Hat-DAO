`White Hat DAO is a valuable resource for individuals looking to conduct their own research on blockchain projects more effectively and efficiently. The platform compiles various data points and metrics for onboarded projects, helping users make more informed decisions.

We provide a safety score for each project based on various factors, such as code security and potential risks and vulnerabilities. This rating can be helpful for users when evaluating the trustworthiness of a project.

The Governance token has been deployed to govern the protocol fairly with community consent. It will allow community members to propose proposals and allow voting mechanism. `,
`How do investors benefit by investing in White Hat DAO 

Liquidity Providers Incentives:
Liquidity provider (LP) earns yield through trading fees paid by swap users. LPs will receive 100% of all trading fees, which will range from 0.1% to 0.5%.  Note that LPs have exposure to every asset in the pool they provide liquidity for. LP providers will also receive a liquidity mining reward of 50% to 100% APR in WHDT.

Gasless Transaction on swap:
ETH network has highest gas fees among all networks. However, the WHDT token may be traded on Defi without gas fees. Thus making it easy for everyone to participate.

WHDT Index ( AMM ):  
This feature will provide exposure to digital assets via smart contract that can automatically rebalance its positions and continuously will manage liquidity assets as the market changes. This collateralized basket of tokens ( 15 to 20 different best performing tokens on the market )  is packaged by smart contracts and is exchangeable as a single token. This will continuously positively contribute to the value of the WHDT token. All fees & value gets generated 100% of it goes to the liquidity. 
=======
Providing Utility: 
WHDT can be used to directly purchase real life services such as ( entertainment cards, loyalty cards, shopping cards, gift cards, food & travel etc. ). This will provide extra value to the WHDT demand ( 5% charges apply on every purchase, which may be burnt on transaction )

Deflationary System: 
0.1% to 0.5% token may be burnt on every trade. This will push the price up automatically as more transactions take place. Burnt token will be deducted live from the total supply as the transaction happens.

Voting Power:  
WHDT is a governance token. The protocol will be governed by token holders' vote. Any token holder can propose proposals and the community gets to vote with their token to voice their opinion.`,
